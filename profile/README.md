<h2 align="center"><center>The immutable Linux meta-distribution
for edge Kubernetes</center></h2>

With Kairos you can build immutable, bootable Kubernetes and OS images for your edge devices as easily as writing a Dockerfile. Optional P2P mesh with distributed ledger automates node bootstrapping and coordination. Updating nodes is as easy as CI/CD: push a new image to your container registry and let secure, risk-free A/B atomic upgrades do the rest.

- :bowtie: Community Driven
- :octocat: Open Source
- :lock: Linux immutable, meta-distribution
- :key: Secure
- :whale: Container based
- :penguin: Distribution agnostic

Nodes are configured via cloud-init and supports zero-touch configuration and complete lifecycle management with CAPI.

The Kairos 'factory' enables you to build custom bootable OS images for your edge devices, from your choice of OS (including openSUSE, Alpine and Ubuntu) and your choice of edge Kubernetes distribution - Kairos is totally agnostic.
